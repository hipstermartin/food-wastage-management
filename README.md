# Food Wastage Management

Food wastage is a major issue that needs to be addressed urgently. Our Java-based application aims to solve this problem by managing the flow of food waste and redirecting it to those in need. This system involves various organizations, such as restaurants, NGOs, and logistics companies working together to achieve the goal of reducing food wastage.

## How it works

- Restaurants can raise requests for food collection through the application
- These requests are then passed onto all NGOs within the network
- The NGOs can then accept or reject the request based on their capacity to collect the food

- The NGO then distributes the food to the needy people in their network
