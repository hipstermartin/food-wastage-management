# food-wastage-management
A java based application for food wastage management

Food wastage is a massive problem and one of the most overlooked thing in todayâ€™s world.

We have designed a system to curb the wastage by managing the flow of food going waste by redirecting it from the restaurants to the needy people
For this we have different organizations like Restaurants, NGOs, Logistics who working in unison to achieve this goal
Restaurants raise requests for food collection, which are passed onto all NGOs within the network
